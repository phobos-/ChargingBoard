# ChargingBoard
## 1S JST-PH 2.0 series-parallel charging board

This board can balance-charge from 6 to 30 1s lipos. 

## 2S XT30 series-parallel charging board

This board can balance-charge from 3 to 12 2s lipos. 

## How it works

The charger will see the board as a 6s battery. To complete the board you need a balance plug for 6s, an XT60 female connector (or any other connector that fits your charger), 12 XT30 (XT30U) or 30 JST-PH 2.0 standard male connectors and some wire. Make sure to order in 2oz copper for maximum performance.
