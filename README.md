2S XT30 series-parallel charging board

This board can balance-charge from 3 to 12 2s lipos. The charger will see the board as a 6s battery. To complete the board you need a balance plug for 6s, an XT60 female connector (or any other connector that fits your charger), 12 XT30 standard male connectors (XT30U) and some wire. Make sure to order in 2oz copper for maximum performance.
